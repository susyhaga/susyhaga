### Welcome to my GitHub! :tada: 

I'm **Susy Haga**, **Front-end Engineer** student at EBAC with a background in digital marketing. :woman_student:

#### About me :octocat:

:bulb: Creative by soul, curious by lack of options, I've always loved to follow the market trends. Because of the development of technology, I noticed the need to update myself. That's how I ended up on the Web Development course. Everything was new, new people, new languages, and new experiences. Finally, I ended up falling in love with this challenge, which makes me motivated every day because it's a huge world of learning.

:computer: As a marketing strategist, my focus was on the user experience, so I had a lot of interaction with Front-end developers. At that time, I used to ask for impossible things, that's why I felt the need to join a course to better understand the technical side. In the end, I wanted to be one of them.

:rocket: I took courses focusing on Web Development while I was living in Berlin. I came back to Brazil and searched for a more advanced course to join the market as a Front-end Developer. Nowadays, I'm on the Front End Engineer course from EBAC - Escola Brit√¢nica de Artes Criativas e Tecnologia, which is planned to be finished in H1-2024.
